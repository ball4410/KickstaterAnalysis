# KickstaterAnalysis
This is the Module 1 Challenge

Responses
1.	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
The music category has the most successful campaigns. The game category has the most failed campaigns. The most common campaigns are in theater. 
2.	What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some limitations include location and how the campaign was advertised. 
If a lot of the theater data was taken from campaigns based in New York compared to more rural places, then the data would be skewed. 
Also, if a campaign was only shared by word of mouth and one social media platform it may not have gotten as many backers as using multiple media sites.
3.	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Other possible table and/or graphs that could be created is looking at the campaign state and number of backers. This may give an idea of the minimum amount of backers needed for a successful campaign. 

Bonus Statistical Analysis
Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median summarizes the data more meaningfully.
	I think in this example, the average will be more meaningful. The more backers you have, the less of a contribution amount will be needed.  
Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
	There is more variability with successful campaigns. This does make sense. A lot of the failed campaigns have 0 backers.
